# DIG
Design Innovation Group

The Design Innovation Group is an offshoot of several Penn State learning design units that have adopted the following mindset:
- we must create and experiment to push education, pedagogy and technology
- we must be innovative to better connect with learners
- we must work together to build our future
- we strive for creating solutions where pedagogy drives technology, not the reverse.

This isn't just another meeting / group / tribe / committee, it's an action group operating under a framework of collaboration:
- DIG meetings held once a month, large group (proposed Mondays)
- Developer DIG meetings held weekly as coworking sessions to tackle the big problems / ideas identified in large group (proposed Tuesdays)
- Units still hold traditional developer / ID / team meetings, but these can be smaller in scope / more focused on purely internal matters
- Lightening topics / ideas, anything that resonates we focus on
- We are a collective of Markers that build solutions (when it makes sense)
- All creations are open source (GPLv2+)

Example pot of discussion points / ideas to get us kicked off:
- HAX - Envisioning a world without HTML
- interactve self-checks / pop-up video - Using H5P to deliver
- LiveCode - Producing HTML5 interactions that you own in a lite-programming language
- On demand Accessibility registry - Dynamically delivering more accessible content / media to users based on needs
- LQ - Live Question tool Eberly is developing
- Flipping the LMS - Course centric "front-door", deep link into LMS ala paulhibbitts.com
- Poll Monday - Thinking Tuesday - Results Wednesday - glenn
- Lab environments

This is an open group, we are only as useful as the community we can foster. This is a starting point and always available for modification (hence git / markdown). The criteria above are open to modification and we will review the progress and vibe of this group on a quarterly basis to ensure we are still useful (if not, we do something else).
