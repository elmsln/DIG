# DIG Session 3
Title: We are Makers; Let's create.

## Requirements
- Bring a laptop
- Bring ideas for how you could increase engagement via stand alone interactions (examples: self checks, self directed activities)
- Make an account on http://h5p.org so we can get playing faster

## Optional
- Bring an idea for the lightning round w/ something that can be shown if voted

## Intro (2 min)

- what we're here to do

## Open Lightning (~30 min)

- Show / talk / connect on what you've been working on; max 1 minute http://www.online-stopwatch.com/
- The 2-3 things people want to SEE via most votes in real time

## Break out topics (~1 hour)
Break out topics are working groups within DIG that have emerged to work towards accomplishing tangible outcomes. If you'd like to propose one doing the open lightning round you are more then welcome to. These are two that have bubbled up from past sessions.
### OER / Open Curriculum specification
Alex Boyce, Katrina Wehr, and Michael Collins have been exploring an open curriculum specification which go beyond traditional Open educational resources (OER). The Open Curriculum spec would allow for easier ingestion of open materials into any number of CMS/LMS solutions.
### Outcomes
- Learn about this specification in development
- Help inform what pedagogical considerations there are for open curriculum
- Start playing with organizational structures / UML diagraming the nessecary components and structure for this

### H5P - Interactive multimedia builder
Many in DIG and around PSU have been buzzing about a technology called H5P. Bryan Ollendyke will help people register accounts on h5p.org in order to play with the tool. We'll envision how we could start augmenting existing courses with this technology (an HTML5 authorware built directly into CMSs).
### Outcomes
- Learn about H5P by playing and creating in it
- Gain insight into the ideas we all have for interactivity
- Have an interactive item you can demonstrate in your current CMS / LMS context to take back to show others
- Discuss how to address accessibility of things like this
- Give the ELMSLN / other teams some guidelines / roadmap as to what to account for and examples
## Regroup (~20 min)
Some show and tell of what was produced.
