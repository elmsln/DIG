# DIG Session 3
Title: We are Makers; Let's create.

## Requirements
- Bring a laptop
- Bring ideas for how you could increase engagement via stand alone interactions (examples: self checks, self directed activities)
- Make an account on http://h5p.org so we can get playing faster

## Optional
- Bring an idea for the lightning round w/ something that can be shown if voted

## Open Lightning (30 min)
- Show / talk / connect on what you've been working on; max 1 minute http://www.online-stopwatch.com/
- The 2-3 things people want to SEE via most votes in real time

## Special Topic - Git for content we all produce (30 min)
We all have to manage content and flows of instruction; whether in Canvas, ANGEL, Drupal, ELMS, Plone, etc. The process surrounding creation and management of content is a big deal regardless of CMS.
The process and workflows of managing content is what we'll explore; as well as how we could work towards more sustainable and sharable OER (to empower other makers).
### See how people handle
- multiple faculty
- multiple versions / sections
- management over time (semester to semester, branching, forking, etc)
- multiple delivery mechanisms

### Outcomes
- Better understanding of the process we engage in for this
- Show solution that Smeal, Eberly, A&A are working towards
- Get a better understanding of Git and why we all need to get on it

## Engage (30+ min)
H5P is a transformational tool that will increasingly be getting more attention in higher education.
It's effectively, HTML5 based authorware and ELMS:LN / Drupal already have built in support for it so many in attendence will have access to be able to run locally with what we review.
For those not, the great thing about H5P is its intended to be created in a CMS but then shared / embedded elsewhere. So imagine an interactive asset managmenet system and then you embed the by-products in Canvas, ELMS, static HTML; it no longer matters where it goes!

The critical different between this and all tools in the history of authorware:
- the platform itself is open source / deployed locally
- the products created are open source (and html5 which most others still aren't)
- The interactions are overlayed on media, not directly embedded in it (so you can swap out a tutorail video as 1 example)
How can we use this tool effectively? What ideas can our maker community bring to the table so we can all learn together how to use this and what can be done with it.
### Outcomes
- Learn about H5P by playing and creating in it
- Gain insight into the ideas we all have for interactivity
- Have an interactive item you can demonstrate in your current CMS / LMS context to take back to show others
- Discuss how to address accessibility of things like this
