Renne
Lions cage competition, shark tank kind of thing
- Smeal business plan manager
- students build out a business plan
- students didn't want a leader board
- gamification, star rating
- leader board (planned)
Ideas from this
- faculty concerned about students seeing a store / star rating; maybe make it a qualitative rubric that they dont see the score but get feedback statements
- stat also have the gamified concept w/ ratings and competition
- held back some of the "money" in order to force revision
- encouraging sensitive competition is difficult

Who's doing what, how are they doing, gradebook writing based on the practice problems they've gotten

Bob
Working with H5P Transitioning over to Drupal site

- suggestion to rip these values to a gradebook of sorts that's imported after the fact
